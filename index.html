			<p><i>While designers cultural ambitions seem to be always on the rise, what we often get is yet another
					form of a-critical graphic design</i></p>
			<p>A few uppercase words, centred or ranged at the top-left corner of a page, set in the regular weight of
				any grotesque font. More often than not, it&#39s black type on white, or the reverse, but colours may
				appear. Be it an international design exhibition, a show for the Venice Biennale, a new artist-run space
				or the output of a design school, in recent years our western &#34art-design&#34 bubble is flooded with
				similar solutions.</p>
			<p>While I was vainly waiting for this trend to slowly fade out, like any other tag on Trend List(which
				doesn&#39t list this one), I realised I needed a name to define it and to explain the annoyance I felt
				about it.</p>
			<p>Over time I recognised a similar annoyance when randomly listening to music on the radio, and realised
				there is an audio equivalent to this typographic sameness: it&#39s Auto-Tune. Auto-Tune was originally
				developed as a tool to automatically correct vocal tracks in order to make them sound perfectly in tune,
				by removing accidental deviations from the melody; as we all know by now, it has turned into the
				standard voice treatment for a great amount of contemporary pop music productions, and is widespread to
				the point of being almost impossible to avoid.</p>
			<p>Likewise, this default, CAPS-LOCK typographic treatment is largely present in our visual landscape. It
				can be applied to almost anything, and makes this anything instantly look OK, fit for our times (at
				least from a designer&#39s perspective). This is AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY.</p>
			<p>In 1995, on Emigre#34, Mr Keedy wrote a piece titled Zombie Modernism. It Lives!, claiming that
				&#34modernism is no longer a style, it&#39s an ideology, and that ideology is conservatism.&#34 What
				I&#39m observing in recent years is not a new personification of that conservative take on modernism:
				this one is apparently devoid of any ideology, and goes even further in renouncing to visually and
				typographically articulate a thought.</p>
			<p>To articulate refers to the ability to express a thought while preserving its nuances and complexity. The
				verb is also etymologically connected to our articulations, the joints in our body which allow us to
				move with elasticity and to adapt our range of action to the needs of each situation. If this sensation
				relates to your experience, imagine then your knees and elbows are blocked: the range of your movements
				is reduced, the ease of action disappears, your possibility to react is limited. This all-caps,
				no-contrast typography has a similar limiting effect on communication: it moves inflexibly in the world,
				it evens its contents out and ends up only communicating itself. But what does it exactly stand for?</p>
			<p>AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY could be considered as one of the many manifestations of &#34normcore&#34 or
				&#34post-authentic&#34 graphic design, two labels currently used to identify reactions to previous
				visual trends seeking an idyllic &#34authenticity&#34 both labels relate to the concept of &#34default
				systems design&#34, which has been discussed for almost twenty years now.</p>
			<p>The abundance of quotation marks shows my distance from this debate. In this struggle to establish
				who&#39s more &#34authentic&#34 or &#34sincere&#34, I prefer taking another perspective: one that
				acknowledges the existence of conventions, cultural norms, standards, templates, styles, tested
				solutions, and the fact that designers can rely on them in their work, but doesn&#39t give up the idea
				that a project requires the time to be considered before being quickly boxed into an existing shape.
				When using and re-using graphic formulae, we could at least try to be aware of their origin and meaning
				(if any), and of the reasons why we&#39re using them.</p>
			<p>While collecting examples to illustrate this article, I noticed two attitudes towards this TYPOGRAPHY: to
				some designers it&#39s the default setting, while others consider it as one of many available options,
				which can be chosen when trying to position a project within a given niche or subculture.</p>
			<p>In fact, quite paradoxically, this typographic monoculture seems to thrive in European independent art
				publishing and events, and in schools with cultural ambitions; the paradox lies in seeing its extreme
				conformism and disregard to visual diversity used to support and promote alternative content, often self
				produced and loaded with critical expectations which are instantly denied by its flattened-out visual
				presentation.</p>
			<p>If Auto-Tune&#39s effectiveness lies in removing errors or in minimizing a singer&#39s peculiar vocal
				timbre, AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY works because it transforms words into undifferentiated blocks that can be
				placed on a page without worrying too much: text becomes an unproblematic material. AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY
				turns visual design into an automatic, a-critical activity, and gives up what I believe is still
				essential to this practice: taking responsibility for what things look like.</p>
