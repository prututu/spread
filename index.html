					<p><i>While designers cultural ambitions seem to be always on the rise, what we often get is yet
							another form of a-critical graphic design</i></p>
					<p>A few uppercase words, centred or ranged at the top-left corner of a page, set in the regular
						weight of any grotesque font. More often than not, it&#39s black type on white, or the reverse,
						but colours may
						appear. Be it an international design exhibition, a show for the Venice Biennale, a new
						artist-run space
						or the output of a design school, in recent years our western &#34art-design&#34 bubble is
						flooded with
						similar solutions.</p>
					<p>While I was vainly waiting for this trend to slowly fade out, like any other tag on Trend
						List(which
						doesn&#39t list this one), I realised I needed a name to define it and to explain the annoyance
						I felt
						about it.</p>
					<p>Over time I recognised a similar annoyance when randomly listening to music on the radio, and
						realised
						there is an audio equivalent to this typographic sameness: it&#39s Auto-Tune. Auto-Tune was
						originally
						developed as a tool to automatically correct vocal tracks in order to make them sound perfectly
						in tune,
						by removing accidental deviations from the melody; as we all know by now, it has turned into the
						standard voice treatment for a great amount of contemporary pop music productions, and is
						widespread to
						the point of being almost impossible to avoid.</p>
					<p>Likewise, this default, CAPS-LOCK typographic treatment is largely present in our visual
						landscape. It
						can be applied to almost anything, and makes this anything instantly look OK, fit for our times
						(at
						least from a designer&#39s perspective). This is AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY.</p>
					<p>In 1995, on Emigre#34, Mr Keedy wrote a piece titled Zombie Modernism. It Lives!, claiming that
						&#34modernism is no longer a style, it&#39s an ideology, and that ideology is conservatism.&#34
						What
						I&#39m observing in recent years is not a new personification of that conservative take on
						modernism:
						this one is apparently devoid of any ideology, and goes even further in renouncing to visually
						and
						typographically articulate a thought.</p>
					<p>To articulate refers to the ability to express a thought while preserving its nuances and
						complexity. The
						verb is also etymologically connected to our articulations, the joints in our body which allow
						us to
						move with elasticity and to adapt our range of action to the needs of each situation. If this
						sensation
						relates to your experience, imagine then your knees and elbows are blocked: the range of your
						movements
						is reduced, the ease of action disappears, your possibility to react is limited. This all-caps,
						no-contrast typography has a similar limiting effect on communication: it moves inflexibly in
						the world,
						it evens its contents out and ends up only communicating itself. But what does it exactly stand
						for?</p>
					<p>AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY could be considered as one of the many manifestations of &#34normcore&#34 or
						&#34post-authentic&#34 graphic design, two labels currently used to identify reactions to
						previous
						visual trends seeking an idyllic &#34authenticity&#34 both labels relate to the concept of
						&#34default
						systems design&#34, which has been discussed for almost twenty years now.</p>
					<p>The abundance of quotation marks shows my distance from this debate. In this struggle to
						establish
						who&#39s more &#34authentic&#34 or &#34sincere&#34, I prefer taking another perspective: one
						that
						acknowledges the existence of conventions, cultural norms, standards, templates, styles, tested
						solutions, and the fact that designers can rely on them in their work, but doesn&#39t give up
						the idea
						that a project requires the time to be considered before being quickly boxed into an existing
						shape.
						When using and re-using graphic formulae, we could at least try to be aware of their origin and
						meaning
						(if any), and of the reasons why we&#39re using them.</p>
					<p>While collecting examples to illustrate this article, I noticed two attitudes towards this
						TYPOGRAPHY: to
						some designers it&#39s the default setting, while others consider it as one of many available
						options,
						which can be chosen when trying to position a project within a given niche or subculture.</p>
					<p>In fact, quite paradoxically, this typographic monoculture seems to thrive in European
						independent art
						publishing and events, and in schools with cultural ambitions; the paradox lies in seeing its
						extreme
						conformism and disregard to visual diversity used to support and promote alternative content,
						often self
						produced and loaded with critical expectations which are instantly denied by its flattened-out
						visual
						presentation.</p>
					<p>If Auto-Tune&#39s effectiveness lies in removing errors or in minimizing a singer&#39s peculiar
						vocal
						timbre, AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY works because it transforms words into undifferentiated blocks that
						can be
						placed on a page without worrying too much: text becomes an unproblematic material. AUTO-TUNE
						TYPOGRAPHY
						turns visual design into an automatic, a-critical activity, and gives up what I believe is still
						essential to this practice: taking responsibility for what things look like.</p>
